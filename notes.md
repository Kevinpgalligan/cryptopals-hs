* Configuring Emacs for Haskell:
  * The [first guide](github.com/serras/emacs-haskell-tutorial/blob/master/tutorial.md) that came up when I searched "haskell emacs" suggested using the ghc-mod executable, which is DEPRECATED and can't even be installed through my version of cabal without a dependency conflict. This was very annoying and wasted a lot of my time. UGH.
