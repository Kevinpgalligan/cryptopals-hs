## Cryptopals in Haskell
I'm doing the [cryptopals challenges](https://cryptopals.com/) to familiarise / refamiliarise myself with Haskell, which I dabbled with back in my first years of programming. Emacs (with haskell-mode) is my editor of choice. I load the code in each solution file with `C-c l` and test it at the REPL.
